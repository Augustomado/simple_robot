### üíª Code Overview 

- The Arduino code listens for Bluetooth commands sent from a smartphone and controls the motors accordingly via the **L298N motor driver**.
- Currently, the robot runs at a **fixed speed**, which is set using `analogWrite()` on the enable pins.  
> This was implemented intentionally because **it's not recommended to leave the enable pins permanently jumped**.  
However, you can easily modify the code to adjust the speed dynamically using different PWM values (0-255). 

```cpp
void setup{
#define ENA 11 // PWM Pins
...
#define ENB 6 // PWM Pins
}

```

### üî¢ Steps
1) Upload the code to your Arduino UNO 
  -  ‚ö†Ô∏è Disconnect the HC-05(RX/TX) while uploading code to avoid serial conflict 
2) Connect all components according to the circuit diagram 
3) Install a Bluetooth controller app on your smartphone;
4) Pair with the HC-05 module (default PIN is usually 1234 or 0000) 
5) Setup your gamepad to send the following commands 
   - W - Move Forward 
   - S - Move Backward 
   - A - Turn Left 
   - D - Turn Right
